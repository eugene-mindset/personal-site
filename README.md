Making a website to act as an online resume/portfolio.

## Technologies

I used the powerful CSS library Less v3.11.1 to give me more power in structuring my CSS and
allowing a more 'programmatic' approach to creating the design. I compile the .less files to .css
by using the Less compiler, which is installed through npm. To compile the files, I simply:

1. Locate the root of repo
1. Enter the command ```lessc ./css/main.less ./css/index.css```

I am also using JQuery v3.5.1 to handle functionality and some of the visual design that
requires more than just CSS.
