# personal-site

Making a website to act as an online resume/portfolio. Located at [here](https://eugene-mindset.github.io/personal-site) for now.

## Goals

Useful checkpoints for me to follow.

- [X] Finish the mobile version of site.
- [X] Preview this on your phone. Might require to use some basic method of
hosting the site.

## Technologies

I used the Less library to give me more power in structuring my CSS. I compile the .less files to .css
by using its compiler, which is installed through npm. To compile the files, I simply:

1. Locate the root of repo
1. Enter the command ```lessc ./css/main.less ./css/index.css```

I am also using JQuery v3.5.1 to handle functionality and some of the visual design that
requires more than just CSS.

Just me and my thoughts.

Added a hobbies section (WIP). Working on each section to give it more personality, currently on skills.

- [ ] Make menu links more obvious that they are menu links. Maybe have the surrounding text of the menu fade in a bit after.
- [ ] Add some interesting way of conveying the timelines of items. Maybe a drop down menu kind of thing or have a line running through the dates.
- [ ] Have relevant skills contain projects subsections
- [ ] Make it so some of this information can be loaded from a JSON file.
- [X] Refactor CSS code to better structure properties and make it apparent what things should do what
- [ ] Refactor JavaScript code to make it clear what certain blocks are doing. Make it more configurable.
- [X] Cleanup HTML
- [ ] Provide an icon for page

Redoing the design of the site. Almost finished with the mobile design but need to fix a couple of things:

- [X] Fix color transition. It just needs to fade out and then adjust the content and then change color.
- [X] Center menu only on home page.
- [X] Rework the centering of the menu to not use top.

I've recently recommited myself to working on this, and I've pretty much reset the design after not
liking my initial vision of it. As well, I was trying to build the mobile and desktop vesrions of
the site up at the same time, so I restarted my progress with focusing on mobile design of the site
first.
