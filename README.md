# personal-site

Making a website to act as an online resume/portfolio.

## Goals

Useful checkpoints for me to follow.

- [ ] Finish the mobile version of site.
- [ ] Preview this on your phone. Might require to use some basic method of
hosting the site.

## Technologies

I used the powerful CSS library Less v3.11.1 to give me more power in structuring my CSS and
allowing a more 'programmatic' approach to creating the design. I compile the .less files to .css
by using the Less compiler, which is installed through npm. To compile the files, I simply:

1. Locate the root of repo
1. Enter the command ```lessc ./css/main.less ./css/index.css```

I am also using JQuery v3.5.1 to handle functionality and some of the visual design that
requires more than just CSS.

## Log

Just me and my thoughts.

I've recently recommited myself to working on this, and I've pretty much reset the design after not
liking my initial vision of it. As well, I was trying to build the mobile and desktop vesrions of
the site up at the same time, so I restarted my progress with focusing on mobile design of the site
first.
